class ProminentPeakExtractionStrategy(BaseExtractionStrategy):
    """
    An extraction strategy that selects frames corresponding to prominent peaks
    in the character count signal using scipy.signal.find_peaks.

    This strategy identifies frames where the character count is significantly
    higher than its surrounding frames, which can indicate stable slides,
    title cards, or important content points in a video (like a presentation).
    The effectiveness depends heavily on the nature of the video content and
    the chosen parameters.

        """
        Initializes the ProminentPeakExtractionStrategy.

        Args:
            prominence (float): The required prominence of peaks. This value
                represents the minimum vertical distance a peak must stand out
                from its surrounding signal to be identified. A higher value
                selects only more significant peaks. Defaults to 1.0.
                This parameter often requires tuning based on the typical
                character count variations in the specific video content.
                See `scipy.signal.find_peaks` documentation for more details.
            distance (int): The minimum required horizontal distance (in number
                of frames) between neighboring peaks. Peaks closer than this
                distance will be suppressed, keeping only the highest peak
                in the vicinity. Defaults to 1 (meaning peaks can be adjacent
                if they meet other criteria). Increasing this helps avoid
                selecting frames that are very close temporally.
            **kwargs (Any): Additional keyword arguments to pass directly to
                             `scipy.signal.find_peaks`. This allows for fine-tuning
                             using parameters like `width`, `threshold`, `height`, etc.
                             Example: `ProminentPeakExtractionStrategy(prominence=10, width=5)`
